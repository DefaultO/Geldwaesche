# Geldw√§sche
This project wouldn't be possible without https://github.com/appsec-labs/Advanced_Packet_Editor. I coded ontop of this already open source project. What this does is exploiting some state of the [game](https://gangster.goodgamestudios.com/) the [Devs](https://www.goodgamestudios.com/) of it overlooked. When you claim something, the server doesn't yet remember it. Apparantly it only starts to save state-related stuff on the server, when you disconnect.

So by causing a force disconnect by the game server, and not giving the client any time to upload state-related things, you bypass the claim you did and can repeat it. More to it, just by logging into another Account using a login packet, it seem like to bypass the claim upload already, by it, possibly updating the wrong account. This project does a force disconnect though, by loging into the same account at least twice. It's the simplest form of this exploit and I am sure, there are other "force disconnect" methods. This won't work until the eternity and the server starts to figure it out after a lot of claims (if you are lucky).

What makes this so good is that there are no visible signs besides the Achievments that could tell that you did exploit this [game](https://gangster.goodgamestudios.com/). This makes the exploits based on this overlook - ghost features. Means there are no server-sided logs that tell your account is abnormal, neither is it obvious and you probably won't get banned using them (only manuals, and those probably won't happen).

Because this Game stopped getting updates since 2017, [officially stated by the Game Studio](https://goodgamestudios.com/de/blog/warum-goodgame-gangster-shadow-kings-co-keine-updates-erhalten/2016/07/05/), this exploit will stay undetected and work for the rest of it's existence. Because they literally don't touch the game anymore, just keep it running, because people keep paying into it.
