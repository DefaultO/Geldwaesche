# Geldw√§sche
This project wouldn't be possible without https://github.com/appsec-labs/Advanced_Packet_Editor. I coded ontop of this already open source project. What this does is exploiting some state of the game the Devs of it overlooked. When you claim something, the server doesn't yet remember it. Apparantly it only starts to save state-related stuff on the server, when you stop playing this game.

So by causing a force disconnect by the game server, and not giving the client any time to upload state-related things, you bypass the claim you did and can repeat it. More to it, just by logging into another Account using a login packet, you seem to bypass the claim upload, by it, possibly updating the wrong account. This project does a force disconnect though, by loging into the same account at least twice. It's the simplest form of this exploit and I am sure, there are other "force disconnect" methods. This won't work until the eternity and the server starts to figure it out after a lot of claims (if you are lucky).
